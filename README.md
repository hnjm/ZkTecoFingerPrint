# ZkTecoFingerPrint:
ZkTeco SDK & C# library is the worst api i've ever had to deal with, those dumb developer at ZkTeco should be ashamed of releasing an SDK at this state.

if you want to interface with a fingerprint device programmatically AVOID ZKTECO products.

after wasted hours and frustrating trials and errors, i ended up creating a more sane way to use the Abomination that is ZkTeco Usb Fingerprint Reader, still not perfect, but dozen time better than their own SDK.

# Message to ZkTeco Developers or whoever in charge of making SDKs:
your c++ libraries interface sucks, with no documentation.
your .net library is just half ass attempt at wrapping your shitty dlls.
why the fuck you don't interface with your usb devices directly using proper .net library?

i can make your SDK better, faster, and does not make whoever uses it want to shoot themselves than to spend any more second trying to decipher why and how things are done

# Bugs & Issues:
if the issue can be fixed by tweaking the C# code, i'm open to suggestions and code contributions
